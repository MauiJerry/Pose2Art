# --- IMPORTANT NOTES FOR OPENPOSE ---
# OpenPose is typically installed from source or pre-built binaries,
# and its Python bindings might require specific OpenCV versions or build configurations.
# It's not usually installed via pip directly in the same way as other libraries.
# Refer to the official OpenPose GitHub for detailed installation instructions:
# https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose
# You might need to build it with Python bindings enabled.
